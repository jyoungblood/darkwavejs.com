(first blog post)

Say hello to darkwave (/hello cruel world)
  / say hello to my little friend

this project started (in 2015 wow) as a way to codify my "sweet setup" for building apps, collecting my best practices and preferred solutions for doing specific kinds of functionality so i didn't have to keep copying pieces from previous apps and rebuilding the same thing over and over. when i started, of course, there was no npm, and i was dealing with a mess of code samples
  this has made me a lot of money over the years, and i've found the concept supremely valuable
  even though other (admittedly better) solutions exist, this has grown with me over my career, always met my "current" knowledge & skill level, and i've updated it as i've learned new things
  it's always been an advantage that i have a go-to kit / scaffolding that i can start with (especially since i generally build the same kinds of apps over and over)
  competetive advantage that i can build reliable solutions quickly, deliver quality in short order
  i've made it open source so other people can use it, but it's never received very much attention, so whatever ... not my problem
now it's a collection of my "best practices for building web apps" - including the boilerplate for easiest setup w/ pre-scaffolded application, as well as a collection of hot tips and components and recipes for solving specific problems
i deeply desire to avoid the term "battle tested" but i've used these patterns and solutions for A LOT of clients and they work pretty well (even though they, like everything in life, have their various drawbacks ... nothing is perfect, no silver bullets, etc)
  these are well-reasoned pragmatic and tested/validated solutions
again, i don't care if they help you or not, i want a nice web site and organized set of resources i can use (you're welcome to, also, if you'd like)
it's evolved over the years, and will continue to do so
many things have developed since i started making this a less-than-ideal choice for a lot of reasons, but it's still the ideal choice for me, because i understand the fw and i have vetted these solutions (and your ass is not gonna catch me using laravel or rails unless i'm getting paid handsomely)
  it may be the perfect solution for you if you're building the kind of apps i do (specifically internal tools using the same turn-key app base, CRUD apps that require login)
