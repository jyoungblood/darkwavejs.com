This is an example blog post. You can write your content here using MDX.

## Features

- Full MDX support
- Tags and collections
- Draft/published status
- Formatted like docs pages but without the sidebar

## Getting Started

Create new blog posts in `src/content/blog/` with the following frontmatter:

```yaml
---
title: "Your Post Title"
subtitle: "A brief description"
date: "2026-01-23"
tags: ["tag1", "tag2"]
collections: ["collection-name"]
status: "published"
---
```

Set `status: "published"` when you're ready for the post to appear on the site.
