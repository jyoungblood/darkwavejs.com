(saas) application starter kit
Base for building custom applications


starter for building CRUD apps with astro

unified CRUD pattern (reasonable workflow that doesn't change)

you down with UGC?
	dw is designed to support user-generated content (specifically photo uploads) out of the box! bring your own cloud storage (bunny, s3/r2) or serve on your own server (support for local storage on a vps)

dw core focus on handling user-generated content - so many boilerplates help you do basic stuff, but what about when you need "normal" functionality for user generated content? like you want your users to be able to drag/drop photo uploads w/ crop? this is a full stack solution for problems like that

like diy electronics kit (fm transmitter etc)

building saas like building ikea

it's like rocket fuel for astro apps


Modular “pre wired” "full-stack" components
- this vibe - https://www.yankodesign.com/2024/12/04/modular-numpad-concept-adds-some-teenage-engineering-industrial-aesthetic-to-your-workflow
	- Purpose specific functionality blocks with my preferred solutions
	- Designed to provide fast (easy, fun, smooth, productive, manageable, efficient) workflow built on top of reliable (and well chosen) technology / solutions

similar (in spirit) to filament php (components designed to work together)


designed to make the process of building certain kinds of functionality as easy (same level of complexity) as putting together ikea furniture (not always ~easy~ and fast, but it's able to be done by one or two people who can follow directions and understand concepts of how things are assembled)

## Astro on rails


like laravel / rails for Astro






Dw laravel for Astro 
	more like Statamic for Astro, but...
Like tanstack but different stack
Dw build dev stack equivalent of Toyota 4Runner / sequoia
  Reliable dependable useful thing that just works but is still a delight to use (good style, works real good, no bullshit)
The web frameworks for (artistic) js crackheads (with jobs and deadlines)
  Web artisans with [...]attitude problems

{/* 



it's essentially the same idea as laravel breeze (auth/login flows) but also includes components/conventions for specific things (processing photos, form submissions, text editors, modals, etc)



A reliable setup (boilerplate) you can trust so you don't have to start over for every new project


"a pretty nice way to make web apps"
	"helpful strategies for building web apps" / opinions / conventions

{/* 
- guiding principles (conventions, opinions)
- functional modular components (for our chosen/blessed FE & BE technologies) - plug & play full-stack components
- FAST and efficient (and fun!) workflow
- MY toolkit for building saas producs quickly
  - modular pre-configured full-stack components
- Saas starter kit with table stakes features
 */}


{/* 

fast and fun way to build reliable and ambitious(?)[feature-complete, capable] server rendered crud applications and web sites
	- Pre-wired “table stakes” functionality for saas & web products
		- ex: Auth, photo galleries, alerts, modals, billing primitives, user mgmt, form validation, etc  
	- Full stack components  
	- Modular interchangable(?) pieces / functionality / abstractions (primitives, generics)
	- "professional grade" starter kit for building full-stack server-rendered applications with astro and a (tastefully/carefully) curated configuration/collection of helpful tools & libraries

my "sweet setup" for building apps with various configurations
	"want a turn-key "full crud app" w/ form handling and db updating w/ my collection of favorites. would love to have users & auth figured out too"
 */}



{/* 
building dw to be my go-to for saas-like products
	something **i'm** adept at using that's capable and modern
	focus on leverage and building speed
	fewer problems that i have to solve
 */}

{/* 
- FOCUS ON DEV SPEED, BUILD SOMETHING THAT WORKS
  - will pay for reliable solutions
  - horse apps don't need to have HUGE scale to work (be effective)
  - don't want to get lost in the weeds solving problems i don't need/want to solve
    - don't want to fuck with infra or security AT ALL
  - want "table stakes" functionality that i don't have to "invent"
    - 2fa, image uploads, job queues, email service, etc
- focus on building complex features fast & shipping, building the "normal" kinds of apps everyone expects these days
 */}










{/* 
features
- pre-wired application base
- auth
- schemas
- UGC image handlers (uplading, compression, resizing, cdn integration, caching, etc)
	- robust & secure (27 layers!!!) image caching proxy and transformation service, backed by cdn (and optional image transformation service) of your choice
 */}



{/* 
features list

- turn-key (ish) base for admin (forms, tables, content)
- astro config w/ `@` path rendering
- fully (?) typed custom components and backend abstraction functions
- integrated photo uploads (saving in db)
  - single and gallery

 */}


{/* 
stack designed to ship
- Js stack for solo devs who ship
- good stack for building turn-key saas businesses
- Easy to use / maintain tech chooses
- Curated library collection / config
- Covers the basic saas functionality
  - Workflow Lets/encourages you  build features quickly
 */}

{/* 
features
- turnkey prewired functional system
- Auth (w pw & social oauth)
- form handling
- Input validation
- photo uploads
- Auth rules (rbac)
- workflow / opinions / guard rails
- Reasonable preconfigured base upon which to build
 */}

{/* “web development is hard … but it doesn’t have to be” */}












{/* 

here's a poem i wrote about this:

photo uploads are hard  
auth rules are hard  
form validation is hard
all this stuff is hard
	it's not rocket science, but it's not apple pie
i spent time fighting with this shit so i don't have to again!
	made these solved problems! for me! fuck you!
	it's a good stack, but there's A LOT involved in getting it to work the way I need it to

easy on-ramp for more "advanced" features (queues, real-time streaming, elastic search/meili , etc)

{/* 
goal - takes care of all of this shit:
- "
  CRUD is step 0.  
  Real backend devs should know:  
  • Caching  
  • Auth & AuthZ  
  • Rate Limiting  
  • Queues & Workers  
  • Observability  
  • Scaling  
  • Security
Master these. That’s how you ship systems, not just features. - [https://x.com/pixperk_/status/1915984267143770380](https://x.com/pixperk_/status/1915984267143770380)
