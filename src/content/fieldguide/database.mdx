Database configuration and conventions for DW projects.

## Recommended Settings

- **Charset**: `utf8mb4`
- **Collation**: `utf8mb4_general_ci`
- **Engine**: InnoDB (recommended)

These settings support emoji and international characters.

## Standard Fields

Include these fields on most tables:

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `uuid` | varchar(36) | Primary identifier |
| `created_at` | datetime | Creation timestamp |
| `updated_at` | datetime | Last modification |
| `deleted_at` | datetime | Soft delete timestamp |

## Common Patterns

### Photo Fields

```sql
photo_url VARCHAR(255),
photo_url_parameters TEXT
```

### Content Fields

```sql
title VARCHAR(255),
slug VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE,
content TEXT,
status ENUM('draft', 'published')
```

## Design Philosophy

Include fields you know you'll need eventually. Soft deletes (`deleted_at`) are the default pattern - never hard delete data.
