Cross-Origin Resource Sharing configuration.

## Default Setting

CORS is disabled by default in DW:

```js
// astro.config.mjs
security: {
  checkOrigin: false,
},
```

## Enabling CORS

If you need CORS protection, follow the [Astro security configuration guide](https://docs.astro.build/en/reference/configuration-reference/#security).

## When to Enable

Consider enabling CORS if:
- Your API is accessed from different domains
- You need to restrict which origins can make requests
- You're building a public API

For internal applications on a single domain, the default setting is fine.
