Although it's designed to be approachable and beginner-friendly, DW is intended to for professional software developers who are building custom applications for clients.



not intended for novices: to weild this effectively, you have to know what you're doing. it's for professionals who are making professional-grade applications. professionals with deadlines who want to deliver a reliable product


if you like the IDEA of rails or laravel, but 1) want to write javascript, 2) don't want to be SO restricted, this is for you!
- this gives you SOME structure and guidance, but doesn't restrict you TOO much (happy path isn't TOO specific)

Dw is most useful for those who are building internal tools, intranets, company/organization portals
custom ERP software, internal tooling

bespoke web apps

useful for big enterprise apps and small custom sites alike

    - one-off quick & dirty admins like admin.reining
    - turn-key intranet/dashboard
