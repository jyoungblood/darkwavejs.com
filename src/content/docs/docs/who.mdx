DW is designed to be approachable and beginner-friendly, but it's intended for professional software developers building custom applications for clients.

If you like the idea of Rails or Laravel but want to write JavaScript without being too restricted, this is for you. DW provides structure and guidance without excessive constraints.

## Ideal Projects

DW is most useful for:

- Internal tools and intranets
- Company/organization portals
- Custom ERP software
- Bespoke web applications
- Content management systems
- B2B SaaS applications

Particularly suited for managing user-generated content, especially images. Astro is already designed for content-driven websites; DW excels at managing user-generated content.

## Built to Ship

A JavaScript stack for solo devs who ship. Good for building turn-key SaaS businesses. Useful for both large enterprise apps and small custom sites.
