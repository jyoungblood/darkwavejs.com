title: What is it?

THE STACK

dw is a "stack" / spec - specific configuration of specific fws, tools, etc
	responsible choices one might use to build a reliable crud app


---

### GOALS



DW DX/workflow goals ... want to be

- easy to learn (to help teams get up to speed quickly)
- efficient (to enable tasks to be completed as quickly as possible)
- consistent (to prevent teams from wasting time relearning how to do their work)
- transparent (to allow bugs to be diagnosed and solved easily)
- resilient (to ensure what works today also works next year)
- ** on a scale of skateboard to aircraft carrier, it's a cargo van **
  - it doesn't solve EVERY problem, but it has really good solutions for the problems it does solve.
- perfectly suited for quick prototyping - able to produce usable functionality quickly without the fear of it breaking unexpectedly (reliable and fast to produce)




Dw goal - build a robust system boilerplate that’s easy to modify & maintain
	guiding principles / Design decisions - do the predictable obvious thing, nothing too clever (makes debugging & maintenance easier, onboarding new devs, etc)
	designed to be flexible enough to fit a variety of use cases and architectures, work with a variety of services (hosting providers, cdn, images, mailers, etc)



goal: easier (as easy as) installation/deployment than wordpress ... esp want to be easier than laravel

Dw goal - make it just as easy to build a custom crud app as it is to configure a generic 3rd party cms to suit your needs
  if you've evaluated any cms, you've likely hit the frustration of the various configuration nightmares and learning new concepts and thought "i could just build something like this in the same amount of time as it would take to learn it)

Bundled components
Modular

Plug n play system
Assembled for low-friction usage (dev workflow, process)



pragmatic web application runtime
web app sdk



develop w confidence
  Type safety for components




---


(saas) application starter kit
Base for building custom applications


starter for building CRUD apps with astro

unified CRUD pattern (reasonable workflow that doesn't change)

you down with UGC?
	dw is designed to support user-generated content (specifically photo uploads) out of the box! bring your own cloud storage (bunny, s3/r2) or serve on your own server (support for local storage on a vps)

dw core focus on handling user-generated content - so many boilerplates help you do basic stuff, but what about when you need "normal" functionality for user generated content? like you want your users to be able to drag/drop photo uploads w/ crop? this is a full stack solution for problems like that




dw collections (ex demo "links")
- full-stack forms & components for crud operations on specific tables (with space to add your own customizations)
- handles the basic data lifecycle that should take care of 80%* of use cases (creating a collection and managing records for it)




Dw right mix of structure & flexibility
Structure of cms / admin / prebuilt auth, etc
Freedom to build whatever you need (if your client has custom needs, plug your own code in, build onto what we’ve started)





---

## Curated tools bundle



Dw carefully chosen (/vetted /curated) dependencies (/tools/solutions)
Dw tried to make the most "normal" decisions (re: tooling solutions) (Astro tw daisy etc)
Straightforward and obvious choices 
  Not too clever or devious (nonstandard)


do what you can (try to do everything) with the provided libs (alpine, tailwind, etc)




carefully curated collection of libraries / packages and dev tools
  Designed to provide facilitate productive and enjoyable workflow while building a strong reliable performant application, and having fun along the way!
  Helps you build fast too! Easy to change adapt as business /client needs change




Dw curation - most development problems are already solved
We've wired together all the "best" ones (made some pretty good decisions about what to use and how to use it)
Dw curation ethos
Try to make the most normal and obvious decions (tailwind mysql etc)
Straightforward and unsurprising, simple and clear, straightforward and understandable, smart but not overly clever)
Professional grade

like diy electronics kit (fm transmitter etc)

building saas like building ikea

it's like rocket fuel for astro apps


Modular “pre wired” "full-stack" components
- this vibe - https://www.yankodesign.com/2024/12/04/modular-numpad-concept-adds-some-teenage-engineering-industrial-aesthetic-to-your-workflow/?ref=labnotes.org
	- Purpose specific functionality blocks with my preferred solutions
	- Designed to provide fast (easy, fun, smooth, productive, manageable, efficient) workflow built on top of reliable (and well chosen) technology / solutions

similar (in spirit) to filament php (components designed to work together)


designed to make the process of building certain kinds of functionality as easy (same level of complexity) as putting together ikea furniture (not always ~easy~ and fast, but it's able to be done by one or two people who can follow directions and understand concepts of how things are assembled)
	same vibe - https://idea-instructions.com/quick-sort/?ref=labnotes.org

## Astro on rails


like laravel / rails for Astro
  Dw like laravel - have a "go-to" solution for everything you'd want to do with this stack (chosen vetted solutions, but not necessarily done with OUR code), tools that work nicely together 


fw written by (and for) someone who writes apps
	Tried a lot of shit I hated, know what works best for me, know the kind of workflow I want)





Dw laravel for Astro 
	more like Statamic for Astro, but...
Like tanstack but different stack
Dw build dev stack equivalent of Toyota 4Runner / sequoia
  Reliable dependable useful thing that just works but is still a delight to use (good style, works real good, no bullshit)
The web frameworks for (artistic) js crackheads (with jobs and deadlines)
  Web artisans with [...]attitude problems






---


it's essentially the same idea as laravel breeze (auth/login flows) but also includes components/conventions for specific things (processing photos, form submissions, text editors, modals, etc)



A reliable setup (boilerplate) you can trust so you don't have to start over for every new project


"a pretty nice way to make web apps"
	"helpful strategies for building web apps" / opinions / conventions



---


fewer decisions you have to make ... don't worry about it!
Avoid the pitfalls that can come with development (overthinking and over engineering solutions while making lower-level decisions) The bulk of the technical decisions are already made (80%) focus on the (20%) things that make your app unique (logic, service) Build your project quickly and spend more time with your family and friends (Spend less time making boring decisions and more time ...)



astro / dw advantages (over laravel, rails)
- jsx components!
- plug & play w/ any framework components (can use react, vue, svelte)
- easier deployment w/ modern platforms (and relatively easy vps setup, depending on your vps)
- normal file based routing and (relatively) sane app org
- tailwind integrated




- guiding principles (conventions, opinions)
- functional modular components (for our chosen/blessed FE & BE technologies) - plug & play full-stack components
- FAST and efficient (and fun!) workflow
- MY toolkit for building saas producs quickly
  - modular pre-configured full-stack components
- Saas starter kit with table stakes features





fast and fun way to build reliable and ambitious(?)[feature-complete, capable] server rendered crud applications and web sites
	- Pre-wired “table stakes” functionality for saas & web products
		- ex: Auth, photo galleries, alerts, modals, billing primitives, user mgmt, form validation, etc  
	- Full stack components  
	- Modular interchangable(?) pieces / functionality / abstractions (primitives, generics)
	- "professional grade" starter kit for building full-stack server-rendered applications with astro and a (tastefully/carefully) curated configuration/collection of helpful tools & libraries

my "sweet setup" for building apps with various configurations
	"want a turn-key "full crud app" w/ form handling and db updating w/ my collection of favorites. would love to have users & auth figured out too"




Building a reliable stack that makes it easy to take advantage of new opportunities (change directions, adapt to market shifts)
Built to ship AND ALSO Built to last


building dw to be my go-to for saas-like products
	something **i'm** adept at using that's capable and modern
	focus on leverage and building speed
	fewer problems that i have to solve



- FOCUS ON DEV SPEED, BUILD SOMETHING THAT WORKS
  - will pay for reliable solutions
  - horse apps don't need to have HUGE scale to work (be effective)
  - don't want to get lost in the weeds solving problems i don't need/want to solve
    - don't want to fuck with infra or security AT ALL
  - want "table stakes" functionality that i don't have to "invent"
    - 2fa, image uploads, job queues, email service, etc
- focus on building complex features fast & shipping, building the "normal" kinds of apps everyone expects these days





"a great way to make crud apps"
- Part technical framework, part methodology for development (guiding principles) (tied to a specific set of tools, adaptable and extendable boilerplate and scaffolding, pre-wired full stack components

- ( Conceptual ) full stack primitives for crud operations (components, functions, boilerplate code, conventions/opinions/guardrails)
	- a "happy path" for you to follow

- turn-key starter kit, want to be able to build
  - apps like jcdv, sdaa, otp, cb, blu, oip
    - one-off quick & dirty admins like admin.reining
    - turn-key intranet/dashboard
  - public sites like MST & OMA (that have authentication functionality)
  - ?? - eqp admin, eqp client, crag client
- Lamp based web sdk
  - self-hosted BAAS + full-stack primitives
- plugin architecture (free + premium components)



full-stack components / fully integrated pieces of code designed to work together
	Dw slices - full stack components



features
- pre-wired application base
- auth
- schemas
- UGC image handlers (uplading, compression, resizing, cdn integration, caching, etc)
	- robust & secure (27 layers!!!) image caching proxy and transformation service, backed by cdn (and optional image transformation service) of your choice



stack designed to ship
- Js stack for solo devs who ship
- good stack for building turn-key saas businesses
- Easy to use / maintain tech chooses
- Curated library collection / config
- Covers the basic saas functionality
  - Workflow Lets/encourages you  build features quickly



features
- turnkey prewired functional system
- Auth (w pw & social oauth)
- form handling
- Input validation
- photo uploads
- Auth rules (rbac)
- workflow / opinions / guard rails
- Reasonable preconfigured base upon which to build


Getting all the foundational minutiae (fungible, repeated) code out of the way (solving those problems) so you can focus on writing product code (focus on business logic, don’t worry about foundation/infrastructure/architecture)


full stack saas toolkits for degens
	Chaotically running toward a solution  
	  Someone else figured out the reliable parts , edge cases, etc  
	  All you have to do is show up and solve the problems


For building ambitious web apps with ease



---


not just for BIG enterprise apps, it's great for small sites that just need the basic structure (the boring problems are already solved)
	focus on being minimal, small, lightweight, fast (performance), fast (development speed), easy & cheap to deploy

dw for building bespoke web apps

“web development is hard … but it doesn’t have to be”


---



here's a poem i wrote about this:

photo uploads are hard  
auth rules are hard  
form validation is hard
all this stuff is hard
	it's not rocket science, but it's not apple pie
i spent time fighting with this shit so i don't have to again!
	made these solved problems! for me! fuck you!
	it's a good stack, but there's A LOT involved in getting it to work the way I need it to

easy on-ramp for more "advanced" features (queues, real-time streaming, elastic search/meili , etc)

"good enough" components


component vibes 
- goal is to have something that works, is fast, and feels good to use  
    easy enough to maintain and extend  
    reiable, dont' have to worry about it breaking under stress

- doesn't have to be "bespoke" / "craft" / "couture" ui, it just needs to look normal  
  	generic but nice, bonus points for more "luxury" aesthetics, but not required








---


who is it for?


not for novices
- you have to be a developer to wield this effectively
- it's for professionals who are making professional-grade applications



Dw for building internal tools, intranets, company/organization portals
custom ERP software, internal tooling


Dw perfect for building formware apps [https://twitter.com/tonyennis/status/1725803647374635444?s=46&amp;t=l7wRi4wE6KFhNZJNnPZNmg](https://twitter.com/tonyennis/status/1725803647374635444?s=46&t=l7wRi4wE6KFhNZJNnPZNmg)

goal - takes care of all of this shit:
- "
  CRUD is step 0.  
  Real backend devs should know:  
  • Caching  
  • Auth & AuthZ  
  • Rate Limiting  
  • Queues & Workers  
  • Observability  
  • Scaling  
  • Security
Master these. That’s how you ship systems, not just features. - [https://x.com/pixperk_/status/1915984267143770380](https://x.com/pixperk_/status/1915984267143770380)

Typescript on whales
	Thanks for all the fish
	Rails for Astro ssr





basic structure and pre-wired back-end functionality (so you're not starting from scratch every time) high level abstractions
