3 major pieces


The stack
  Major & minor supporting libs / set of common dependencies 
  Custom packages / utilities developed as needed (dw-cli, components, etc)

The boilerplate 
  Blank app - Pre-wired auth, middleware etc
  Extendable Admin app

The philosophy 



---







In practice, Darkwave is just a starter kit for Astro. 

At a higher level, however, it's [an entire paradigm](/docs/ethos) for building web applications.

When combined, this boilerplate and philosophy enable a very efficient and enjoyable workflow.

{/* (working theory, practice, philosophy, idology, etc)  */}

{/* In practice itâ€™s just an Astro theme & boilerplate, but in (theory/reality) itâ€™s so much more.  */}

{/* it's a very efficient workflow and conceptual (guideline, mental framework) */}

{/* the boring problems are already solved - it aims to solve the boring problems (picking out the right basic technology and putting it together) */}

{/* - Part technical framework, part methodology for development (guiding principles) (tied to a specific set of tools, adaptable and extendable boilerplate and scaffolding, pre-wired full stack components */}

{/* - ( Conceptual ) full stack primitives for crud operations (components, functions, boilerplate code, conventions/opinions/guardrails) */}




Building a reliable stack that makes it easy to take advantage of new opportunities (change directions, adapt to market shifts)
Built to ship AND ALSO Built to last










## The Stack

Darkwave is primarily a "stack," or a pre-wired configuration of specific frameworks, libraries, and dev tools. We intentionally made straightforward responsible choices one might use to build a reliable CRUD app.

You don't have to deal with the foundational minutae that comes with starting a new project. The boring problems are already solved: we've done the research, evaluated the available options, and gone to the trouble of putting together a good starting point to build an application.




### Core Stack

- [Astro](https://astro.build) (SSR w/ [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) adapter and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) support)
- [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) (8.0) with [Kysely](https://kysely.dev/) query builder & cli
- [Better-Auth](https://www.better-auth.com/)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) with [FlyonUI](https://flyonui.com/)

### Supporting Libraries

- [Alpine.js](https://alpinejs.dev/)
- [HTMX](https://htmx.org/)
- [Cropper.js](https://fengyuanchen.github.io/cropperjs/)
- [Dropzone](https://www.dropzone.dev/)
- [SortableJS](https://sortablejs.github.io/Sortable/)
- [Validator.js](https://github.com/validatorjs/validator.js)
- [Iconify](https://iconify.design/)
- [Nodemailer](https://nodemailer.com/)






## The Boilerplate
- app structure
  - middleware
  - config mgmt
  - db schemas
  - default CSP, CSRF validation for forms
  - .env boilerplate & integration
- astro config
  - Alias imports (@/ path resolution)
  - Development mode conveniences (local cookie handling)
- auth system
  - JWT-based authentication middleware
  - role-based access control
  - OAuth configured with Google login
  - login/auth flow
    - register/login templates and BE handlers wired with better-auth (& nodemailer)
- components
  - basic form ui
  - form validation
  - input validation
  - integrated form handling with back-end components (buttons that submit forms in a specific way, back-end routes that handle the data in a specific way)
  - fancier components - photo uploads, gallery, audio, text editors, etc
    - File upload handling with storage providers for S3/R2, Bunny.net, and, local filesystem
    - Image processing handlers (optimization, cropping)
- backend
  - helpers
  - crud abstraction
  - Email notifications TSX components
- admin app
  - wannabe wordpress admin
  - simple base you can extend as needed
  - you can ignore it, too, who cares





## The Philosophy / Workflow


DW is basically just how I build web sites
My best practices Codified in a a general way that other people can understand (including me)

- enough examples between the codebase and the docs for you to get the gist of how to build with this
  - Clear coding standards and best practices
