- code should be easy to write, easy to read (easy to understand what’s happening) … basic and simple, no frills

	"a very good thing to move forward from cruds is to start caching and handle cache invalidations very well.
		- separate all concerns. [repository for db calls, config, service for business logic, router and handler]
		- writing good middlewares (auth, logger, rate limiters)
		- metrics with prometheus 
		- use mqs for asynchronousity
		- can write some microservices too
		- grpc"
	if you want to move on from crud apps, that's the direction to go, sure, but like, (let's say) 80% of developers never will need to do that (and honestly it's probably a lot more). naive teenage view thinking that THOSE are the skills you NEED to pursue
	in the comments, everyone is like "but everything is crud apps, you're just talking about distributed crud apps"





focus on creating readable code that's clear at a glance what it does Accessible for non-expert users Minimal abstraction and magic Even if it's more verbose and not the <sub>best</sub> way to do something Aiming to build something that's pragmatic and just works Providing value, solving problems (for customers)

for creating web apps that are Reliable Maintainable Low effort Flexible Valuable - above all, highly usable and focused on solving problems for users Doing what they need to in a pleasant (joy sparking) way (at most a delight to use, at least not frustrating)
