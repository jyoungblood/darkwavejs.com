A meme is worth a thousand manifestos

Modular ‚Äúpre wired‚Äù "full-stack" components
- this vibe - https://www.yankodesign.com/2024/12/04/modular-numpad-concept-adds-some-teenage-engineering-industrial-aesthetic-to-your-workflow
	- Purpose specific functionality blocks with my preferred solutions
	- Designed to provide fast (easy, fun, smooth, productive, manageable, efficient) workflow built on top of reliable (and well chosen) technology / solutions



designed to make the process of building certain kinds of functionality as easy (same level of complexity) as putting together ikea furniture (not always ~easy~ and fast, but it's able to be done by one or two people who can follow directions and understand concepts of how things are assembled)
	same vibe - https://idea-instructions.com/quick-sort




like diy electronics kit (fm transmitter etc)

did you ever play with one of these when you were a kid? i sure did:

i made an AM transmitter and pretended to have a radio show that other people could listen to. it was a lot of fun.





      Imagine this concept, but for web apps:<br /><br />
