### Web application development kit

Darkwave is a "batteries-included" tool kit for building data-driven web applications with Astro. 

We've curated a selection of reliable and approachable tools to create a professional-grade full-stack boilerplate with pre-wired functionality and components for common SaaS and CRUD features.

DW facilitates a hyper-productive development workflow, helping developers focus on delivering real value with ease.

## Getting Started

Clone the repository
```bash
npx degit jyoungblood/darkwave my-project
cd my-project
```

Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

Initialize your database and SMTP account, have the credentials ready to add to your new .env file.

Configure environment variables (add your database, mail server, etc)
```bash
mv .env.example .env
```

Generate [Better-Auth secret](https://www.better-auth.com/docs/installation) (save this to your .env file)
```bash
openssl rand -base64 32
```

Initialize the database (and optionally create admin user)
```bash
npm run init
```

Start development server
```bash
npm run dev
```

Refer to the [documentation](https://darkwavejs.com/) for next steps.

what is it (introduction, core concepts, rationale/manifesto (why we chose certain tech))

intro here - from the readme - https://github.com/jyoungblood/darkwave


Full sack web apps with Astro? You bet!

Building full stack apps with Astro can be fun and rewarding!

DW = don't worry


we've been slowly working on this thing for YEARS, and now it's at a point where i'm feeling comfortable building in public. while it's not quite ready for prime time yet, you're welcome to take a look and maybe give it a spin






in practice it's a starter kit for Astro
in theory, it's a whole (working theory, practice, philosophy, idology, etc) (there's a single word for this that i can't think of at the moment)


ITS ALL ABOUT THE WORKFLOW
- technical components for sure, but it's less of a technical fw and more of a conceptual [workflow, perspective, ideaology] for how to build this kind of functionality in a modular way (with interchangable pieces) that is both maintainable and [makes sense, is fun to build, bla blah]
- it's an ideology, it's a way of life
- A pragmatic approach to developing high quality data-driven applications quickly and reliably

"The value prop is simple: **We help you get started faster. You are purchasing time.** We've thought hard about all the problems like link routing, data-binding, undo and redo, for quite some time so that you can get to making your application faster and more reliable than otherwise."
