Full sack web apps with Astro? You bet!

Building full stack apps with Astro can be fun and rewarding!

Dw = don't worry


we've been slowly working on this thing for YEARS, and now it's at a point where i'm feeling comfortable building in public. while it's not quite ready for prime time yet, you're welcome to take a look and maybe give it a spin




![every app is just crud & permissions](/images/crud-busmeme.jpg)


in practice it's a starter kit for Astro
in theory, it's a whole (working theory, practice, philosophy, idology, etc) (there's a single word for this that i can't think of at the moment)


ITS ALL ABOUT THE WORKFLOW
- technical components for sure, but it's less of a technical fw and more of a conceptual [workflow, perspective, ideaology] for how to build this kind of functionality in a modular way (with interchangable pieces) that is both maintainable and [makes sense, is fun to build, bla blah]
- it's an ideology, it's a way of life
- A pragmatic approach to developing high quality data-driven applications quickly and reliably
