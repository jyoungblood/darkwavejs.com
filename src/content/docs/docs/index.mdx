Darkwave is a "batteries-included" tool kit for building data-driven web
applications with Astro.

We have meticulously curated a selection of reliable and approachable tools to create
a professional-grade full-stack boilerplate with pre-wired functionality
and components for common SaaS and CRUD features.

DW facilitates a hyper-productive development workflow, helping
developers focus on delivering real value with ease.









## Full sack web apps with Astro? You bet!

Building full stack apps with Astro can be fun and rewarding! Astro itself is beginner-friendly while being robust and capable of supporting professional funcitonality.











## DW = don't worry

It's simple: **We help you get started faster.** We've thought hard about all the problems like (blah blah blah), for quite some time so that you can get to making your application faster and more reliable than otherwise.

We've been slowly working on this concept for YEARS, and now it's at a point where i'm feeling comfortable building in public. while it's not quite ready for prime time yet, you're welcome to take a look and maybe give it a spin

Fewer decisions you have to make ... don't worry about it! Avoid the pitfalls that can come with development (overthinking and over engineering solutions while making lower-level decisions) The bulk of the technical decisions are already made (80%) focus on the (20%) things that make your app unique (logic, service) Build your project quickly and spend more time with your family and friends (Spend less time making boring decisions and more time ...)









## It's all about the workflow

DW includes technical, but it's less of a technical framework and more of a methodology for how to build this kind of functionality in a modular way (with interchangable pieces) that is both understandable and maintainable.

It's a pragmatic approach to developing high quality data-driven applications quickly and reliably.

It's an ideology, it's a way of life.
