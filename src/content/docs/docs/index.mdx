Darkwave is a "batteries-included" tool kit for building data-driven web
applications with Astro.

We have meticulously curated a selection of reliable and approachable tools to create
a professional-grade full-stack boilerplate with pre-wired functionality
and components for common SaaS and CRUD features.

DW facilitates a hyper-productive development workflow, helping
developers focus on delivering real value with ease.



## Full sack web apps with Astro? You bet!

Building full stack apps with Astro can be fun and rewarding! Astro itself is beginner-friendly while being robust and capable of supporting professional funcitonality.




## DW = don't worry

"The value prop is simple: **We help you get started faster. You are purchasing time.** We've thought hard about all the problems like link routing, data-binding, undo and redo, for quite some time so that you can get to making your application faster and more reliable than otherwise."

We've been slowly working on this concept for YEARS, and now it's at a point where i'm feeling comfortable building in public. while it's not quite ready for prime time yet, you're welcome to take a look and maybe give it a spin






## It's all about the workflow

DW includes technical components for sure, but it's less of a technical framework and more of a conceptual ideology for how to build this kind of functionality in a modular way (with interchangable pieces) that is both understandable and maintainable.

It's a pragmatic approach to developing high quality data-driven applications quickly and reliably.

It's an ideology, it's a way of life.
