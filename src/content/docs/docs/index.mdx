        Darkwave is a "batteries-included" tool kit for building data-driven web
        applications with Astro.

        We have meticulously curated a selection of reliable and approachable tools to create
        a professional-grade full-stack boilerplate with pre-wired functionality
        and components for common SaaS and CRUD features.

        DW facilitates a hyper-productive development workflow, helping
        developers focus on delivering real value with ease.

Full sack web apps with Astro? You bet!

Building full stack apps with Astro can be fun and rewarding!

DW = don't worry


we've been slowly working on this thing for YEARS, and now it's at a point where i'm feeling comfortable building in public. while it's not quite ready for prime time yet, you're welcome to take a look and maybe give it a spin




![every app is just crud & permissions](/images/crud-busmeme.jpg)


in practice it's a starter kit for Astro
in theory, it's a whole (working theory, practice, philosophy, idology, etc) (there's a single word for this that i can't think of at the moment)


ITS ALL ABOUT THE WORKFLOW
- technical components for sure, but it's less of a technical fw and more of a conceptual [workflow, perspective, ideaology] for how to build this kind of functionality in a modular way (with interchangable pieces) that is both maintainable and [makes sense, is fun to build, bla blah]
- it's an ideology, it's a way of life
- A pragmatic approach to developing high quality data-driven applications quickly and reliably

(something similar to this)
"The value prop is simple: **We help you get started faster. You are purchasing time.** We've thought hard about all the problems like link routing, data-binding, undo and redo, for quite some time so that you can get to making your application faster and more reliable than otherwise."
