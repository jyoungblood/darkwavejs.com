Form validation script for checking all fields before submission.

## Usage

The script is automatically included with ButtonSubmit. It validates all required fields when the form is submitted.

```astro
<form data-form>
  <InputText label="Name" name="name" required />
  <InputText label="Email" name="email" required />
  <ButtonSubmit text="Submit" form="[data-form]" />
</form>
```

## How It Works

1. Intercepts form submission
2. Checks all fields with `required` attribute
3. Runs any field-level validation rules
4. Prevents submission if any validation fails
5. Shows error messages on invalid fields
