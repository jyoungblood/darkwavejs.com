title: Admin app
---
ðŸšœ

it's a pre-configured back office app that you can extend / modify as needed to build functionality for people who want to give you money

build a database-driven app for your clients! this makes it (relatively) easy to build custom content editors that correlate with front end (end-user-facing) functionality



It's not a cms, but there is auth and an admin app


Wordpress for web apps
Extensible admin app (add your own fu ctionality to it)
Build whatever you need for the FE
Build a site for a client they can manage content themselves, built (by you the developer) to their specifications 
  Making it easy to build full stack custom solutions (to a high degree of quality)



Generics & primitives for web applications
	A set of choices (chosen stack, tools, workflow)
  we've chosen these tools/components for use in the admin app. do a source dive in the codebase and see how we're using them, feel free to use them in your application as well






Dw right mix of structure & flexibility
Structure of cms / admin / prebuilt auth, etc
Freedom to build whatever you need (if your client has custom needs, plug your own code in, build onto what weâ€™ve started)



dw collections (ex demo "links")
- full-stack forms & components for crud operations on specific tables (with space to add your own customizations)
- handles the basic data lifecycle that should take care of 80%* of use cases (creating a collection and managing records for it)
