title: Admin App
---

The admin app is a pre-configured back office application you can extend and modify.

## What It Is

Not a CMS, but a starting point for building database-driven admin interfaces. Build custom content editors that correlate with front-end functionality.

Think of it as WordPress for web apps - an extensible admin foundation that you build on.

## Features

- Pre-built authentication
- User management
- Extensible structure
- CRUD collection patterns

## Collections

Full-stack forms and components for CRUD operations on specific tables with space for customizations. Handles the basic data lifecycle that covers most use cases.

## Philosophy

Right mix of structure and flexibility:
- **Structure**: Pre-built auth, admin shell, component library
- **Freedom**: Build whatever you need for your client's custom requirements
