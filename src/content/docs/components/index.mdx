title: Component Ref
---

copy/paste examples of all my components (from the notes)

dw comes bundled with a handful of useful ui components for building forms

additionally we've included some js/ts-based utilities and classes to help with common functionality

helpers.ts
crud abstraction
alerts
storage providers


TODO:

- have Claude write descriptions of everything the components do (and note all the special debouncing & custom shit weâ€™ve done)

- need concise version for public docs, and thorough internal docs for my purposes (so I know everything it does)
