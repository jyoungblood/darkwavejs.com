would love a grid (or table) here of all the components


kinda like the starlight plugins TOC list - https://starlight.astro.build/resources/plugins/

copy/paste examples of all my components (from the notes)

dw comes bundled with a handful of useful ui components for building forms

additionally we've included some js/ts-based utilities and classes to help with common functionality

helpers.ts
crud abstraction
alerts
storage providers


TODO:

- have Claude write descriptions of everything the components do (and note all the special debouncing & custom shit weâ€™ve done)

- need concise version for public docs, and thorough internal docs for my purposes (so I know everything it does)

form ui components
Dw forms - we WANT to "use the platform" as much as possible, but the platform is insecure and needs some customization to meet business requirements. We've added the necessary base customizations and security config to make it reliable, accessible, and attractive (all with zero effort on your part)
