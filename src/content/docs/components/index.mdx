would love a grid (or table) here of all the components



"good enough" components


component vibes 
- goal is to have something that works, is fast, and feels good to use  
    easy enough to maintain and extend  
    reiable, dont' have to worry about it breaking under stress

- doesn't have to be "bespoke" / "craft" / "couture" ui, it just needs to look normal  
  	generic but nice, bonus points for more "luxury" aesthetics, but not required


full-stack components / fully integrated pieces of code designed to work together
	Dw slices - full stack components




kinda like the starlight plugins TOC list - https://starlight.astro.build/resources/plugins/

copy/paste examples of all my components (from the notes)

dw comes bundled with a handful of useful ui components for building forms

additionally we've included some js/ts-based utilities and classes to help with common functionality

helpers.ts
crud abstraction
alerts
storage providers


TODO:

- have Claude write descriptions of everything the components do (and note all the special debouncing & custom shit weâ€™ve done)

- need concise version for public docs, and thorough internal docs for my purposes (so I know everything it does)

form ui components
Dw forms - we WANT to "use the platform" as much as possible, but the platform is insecure and needs some customization to meet business requirements. We've added the necessary base customizations and security config to make it reliable, accessible, and attractive (all with zero effort on your part)
