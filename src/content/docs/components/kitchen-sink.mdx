Kitchen Sink

- want the dw0.6 kitchen sink (tabler version) except made for/with tailwind
- for inputs and stuff it would be cool to have this as part of the theme builder


- [ ] would love to have a "kitchen sink" demo (maybe in a repo as its own app?) that shows a functional example of all the components and their various configurations
  - [ ] like this! - [https://basecoatui.com/kitchen-sink/](https://basecoatui.com/kitchen-sink/ "‌")
  - cool to have a simple demo page (form, etc) or section (w/ subnav) in the app (like the old dw (0.6) did), but not needed right now
    - would be perfect for theming, look at this and see how the colors
    - future - custom theme builder w/ flyon

	- ?? https://www.npmjs.com/package/astrolab-ui
		- isolated UI development tool into your Astro environment. Astrolab brings all your repositories Astro components into one place where you can view and modify your props and slots on the fly.
		- possible to make the kitchen sink demo with something like this?

Dw field guide component catalog - my go-to favorites for specific kinds of components (vetted/curated solutions, notes on where to find them and how to implement) (flyon, penguin, etc ...from various ui kits / sources), other specific libs for specific solutions (modals, uploaders, text editors, table sorters, etc)
Collection of high quality dw-compatible tools

‌

(from dw 0.6) - the demo is sick, put it on the web site!

- Split it up into pages and that’s the docs
- It’s really cool, just needs to be organized nicely

‌

APEX docs/demo
[] demo page that shows all the custom stuff we can do (and documents all the parameters, notes any backend components) with
\- alerts
\- single photo
\- gallery upload
\- any other custom ui components/scripts we've added
\- form validation / field validation
\- email renderer (w/ mjml) + admin builder/preview/send component
\- ?? modals
\- ?? drawers
\- ?? responsive nav components
\- ?? any new dw-fe kind of stuff
\- form pattern (FE components + BE crud handlers) & conventions

- like the dw kitchen sink demo, add copy/paste & BE components

‌

‌

- [ ] rebuild a tailwind version of the DW bs demo
  - [ ] new /demo section w/ copy/paste demos of EVERYTHING
