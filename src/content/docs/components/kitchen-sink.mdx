Kitchen Sink

- want the dw0.6 kitchen sink (tabler version) except made for/with tailwind
- for inputs and stuff it would be cool to have this as part of the theme builder


- [ ] would love to have a "kitchen sink" demo (maybe in a repo as its own app?) that shows a functional example of all the components and their various configurations
  - [ ] like this! - [https://basecoatui.com/kitchen-sink/](https://basecoatui.com/kitchen-sink/ "‌")
  - cool to have a simple demo page (form, etc) or section (w/ subnav) in the app (like the old dw (0.6) did), but not needed right now
    - would be perfect for theming, look at this and see how the colors
    - future - custom theme builder w/ flyon

Dw field guide component catalog - my go-to favorites for specific kinds of components (vetted/curated solutions, notes on where to find them and how to implement) (flyon, penguin, etc ...from various ui kits / sources), other specific libs for specific solutions (modals, uploaders, text editors, table sorters, etc)
Collection of high quality dw-compatible tools

‌

(from dw 0.6) - the demo is sick, put it on the web site!

- Split it up into pages and that’s the docs
- It’s really cool, just needs to be organized nicely

‌

APEX docs/demo
[] demo page that shows all the custom stuff we can do (and documents all the parameters, notes any backend components) with
\- alerts
\- single photo
\- gallery upload
\- any other custom ui components/scripts we've added
\- form validation / field validation
\- email renderer (w/ mjml) + admin builder/preview/send component
\- ?? modals
\- ?? drawers
\- ?? responsive nav components
\- ?? any new dw-fe kind of stuff
\- form pattern (FE components + BE crud handlers) & conventions

- like the dw kitchen sink demo, add copy/paste & BE components

‌

‌

- [ ] rebuild a tailwind version of the DW bs demo
  - [ ] new /demo section w/ copy/paste demos of EVERYTHING
