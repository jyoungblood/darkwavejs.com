"photo uploads used to be hard ... now they're not"



dw designed to work with cloud image providers (also works locally w/ image service fallback, but prefer bunny or cf images for various reasons ... this biggest of which is that you don't have to worry about building enterprise-grade solutions, but get the value of using them)



add photo/gallery uploads to any table, just add these fields, then add them to your form
- photo\_url, photo\_url_parameters
- ?? (i forget what for galleryâ€¦maybe nothing)



#### PHOTO UPLOAD - SINGLE

```
<PhotoUploadSingle
  related_id={link?.uuid}
  related_table="links"            
  related_column="alt_photo_url"
  url={link?.alt_photo_url}
  url_parameters={link?.alt_photo_url_parameters}
  upload_path="/links/alt"
  file_limit_size={1}
  file_formats="image/jpeg"
  dz_icon="tabler--cloud-upload"
/>
```
