title: Form Validation
---

Form components include built-in validation that runs on submit.

## How It Works

Add the `required` attribute to make fields mandatory. The form won't submit until all required fields are filled.

```astro
<InputText
  label="Email"
  name="email"
  type="email"
  required
/>
```

## Validation Behavior

1. On submit, all required fields are checked
2. Invalid fields show error messages
3. Form only submits when all validations pass

See [Input Validation](/components/input-validation/) for field-level validation rules.
