üöú


dw is like laravel in the sense that we aim to - have a "go-to" solution for everything you'd want to do with this stack (chosen vetted solutions, but not necessarily done with OUR code), tools that work nicely together 




user guide / cookbook / "field guide"
field guide / recipes

FERC / webcraft

this section includes practical "go-to" / endorsed solutions for common (problems) using this toolkit. the technology used isn't always necessarily part of the toolkit, but they're my "if you asked me how to do ____, this is what i'd do" solutions.

smaller tutorials for how to do specific kinds of things


---


code snippet library
- code snippets for common patterns (mostly TW)
  - ex: commonly needed tw markup (two column grid, hamburger menu, etc)
  - not part of ui kit, but copy/paste code for doing specific things


---


a manual (/field guide) for building (effective/attractive/solid/usable) web sites/applications with as little (fanfare/suffering/pretense/) as possible

instructional guides and resources (links to valuable online tools/libraries that can help you solve problems quickly)

my "best-practices" guide for putting stuff together

- cool to have a ref in the docs/guide for migrations / schemas (data structures) for common things like blogs, podcast, profiles, etc
  - specifically concerned w/ migrations at the moment (i'm writing some right now)

- workflow for making db changes
  - update schema
  - update db (ideally with a 3rd party script that can just look at the schema and make changes as needed)
- maintainer note
  - need to keep the default schema for kysely (type definitions) and default schema migrations for better auth in sync as we add new default tables in the future
  - src/config/schema.ts - Used by Kysely for type definitions and database operations in your application
  - src/lib/auth/better.ts - Used by Better-Auth for managing tables and migrations

dw guide - troubleshooting
if you get this: "(node:16267) Warning: To load an ES module, set "type": "module" in the package.json or use the .mjs extension."
don't worry about it, that's npm life baby
BUT if you want to kill the warning, change this in package.json:     "dev": "node --no-warnings astro dev",

dw guide - upgrading libs

- may need to upgrade flyon (if you care) as they make updates frequently - [https://flyonui.com/docs/getting-started/upgrade/](https://flyonui.com/docs/getting-started/upgrade/ "smartCard-inline")
  - npm install flyonui@latest

external components - curated collection of resources

docs - pattern for saving over multiple pages/forms

- documented convention / pattern for saving sections of stuff with multiple screens (like blu spaces)
- Save listings like this, separate horse data, photos, pedigree, ad details, pricing, etc on different screens (different forms, multiple templates, tab/subnav selected)
- Not everything needs to be saved this way, but it needs to be easy to do‚Äç

guide / boilerplate for skeleton screens
  automatic skeleton screens
  ?? implement w/ ‚Äúanimated placeholder‚Äù components?

use the package - placeholders w/ astro - https://github.com/matheusbronca/astro-awaited - skeleton screens / placeholders ***

cookbook / field guide - similar to this - [https://sergiodxa.github.io/remix-utils/?](https://sergiodxa.github.io/remix-utils/? "smartCard-inline")
resources and stuff you'll (i'll) need frequently, commonly needed solutions (that don't need to be included with EVERY project, but if you want tot do it with this sytem, this is THE way to do it)




---

building with dw - copypasta boilerplate
- some of these components/sections/functionality DO require a lot of code, but all the code is boring and the patterns are pretty obvious, you can find an existing pattern (admin/users index/edit/new/save/delete) and copy it, modify for your purposes

- front end / dev resources
  - collection of cool "approved" libraries (ones that we like working with and yield badass results, ideally fitting the same license and ethos of the projects)
- front end best practices
  - the workflows, resources and best practices i use/need to be a productive and efficient FE dev
  - notes of all the tools i use for various things (unix time format, generating favicons, etc)
