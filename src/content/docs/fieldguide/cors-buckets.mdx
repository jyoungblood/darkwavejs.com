title: CORS for R2/S3 buckets

ðŸšœ

ummmm if you're using the audioUpload component with the `directUpload={true}` prop, make sure you set the appropriate CORS rules on your bucket (and remove the localhost part before you launch)

this should probably be in the docs for the component, not the field guide but `_Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯`

r2 CORS
