title: Auth
---

we're using better-auth for authentication and authorization, and we've set up middleware, login/registration flows, and custom utilities for RBAC based on better-auth

it should be mostly turn-key, but you've still got a lot of levers that you can pull

dw docs - need instructions for creating/modifying auth roles (in src/config/auth.ts)

- checklist of what you need to do every time you add a new collection (migration, schema, auth roles, ownership config)
- note example dummy ownership config ("direct" but no "user_id" field check, automatically returns true so you should only use it for "admins can edit anything" patterns)
