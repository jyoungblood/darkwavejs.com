config ref


recommend the default table encoding/charset to support emoji / int’l chars (whatever’s prob fine for just english, but, if you want better support this is the best option)
- charset: utf8mb4 collation: utf8mb4_general_ci
- prob also want to use innodb, but it doesn’t really matter (myisam or whatever default is fine)




note standard for data fields (required & common patterns)

- uuid, created\_at, updated\_at, title, slug, photo_url, etc
- "the rules" - here's what the components expect, here's the "happy path" (structure your data like this and you're golden, it's all plug n play)

db design concept - include fields you KNOW you'll need at some point- https://www.scottantipa.com/yagri.html  
- In general, these are some useful fields to store on almost any table:
  - created\_at
  - updated\_at
  - deleted\_at (soft deletes)
  - created\_by etc
  - permission used during CRUD
