"formware helpers"

methods for saving (new/update) and doing soft deletes
see routes in `/api/links/` to see how we're using them
they check rbac rules for editing, and automatically handle all the db crud
  there's just a lot of boilerplate that would otherwise need to be repeated, DRY version of same pattern reusable for several kinds of operations
provided as a nicety, so if you're needing to do something similar with different constraints you'll want to see how we're doing stuff here and modify as needed


- using crud helpers
  - note that it expects to use a uuid if you want to use the saveHandler
