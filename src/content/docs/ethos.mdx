**On a scale of skateboard to aircraft carrier, it's a cargo van.**

DW doesn't solve every problem, but it has really good solutions for the problems it does solve. Think Toyota 4Runner: reliable, dependable, useful, just works, still a delight to use.

## Guiding Principles

- **Pragmatic solutions using boring techniques** - Professional, maintainable solutions without unnecessary complexity
- **Code that is easy to understand** - Clarity over cleverness
- **Proven, stable patterns** - Over bleeding-edge features
- **Long-term maintainability and reliability**

Code should be easy to write and easy to read. Basic and simple, no frills.

## Conventions over Configuration

DW sets standards: we use Kysely, MySQL, Tailwind, shadcn. If you're using DW, you're not using Prisma or Drizzle.

## Design Goals

- Easy to learn (help teams get up to speed quickly)
- Efficient (enable tasks to be completed as quickly as possible)
- Consistent (prevent teams from wasting time relearning)
- Transparent (allow bugs to be diagnosed and solved easily)
- Resilient (ensure what works today also works next year)
- Perfectly suited for quick prototyping with reliable results

## What We're Building

A robust system boilerplate that's easy to modify and maintain. Do the predictable obvious thing, nothing too clever. Designed to be flexible enough to fit a variety of use cases and work with a variety of services (hosting providers, CDN, image storage, mailers).

Goal: make it just as easy to build a custom CRUD app as it is to configure a generic CMS.
