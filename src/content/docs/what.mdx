Darkwave is three things:

1. **The Stack** - A pre-wired configuration of frameworks, libraries, and dev tools
2. **The Boilerplate** - A starter kit with auth, middleware, and extendable admin
3. **The Philosophy** - Guiding principles for building maintainable applications

In practice, Darkwave is just a starter kit for Astro. At a higher level, it's [an entire paradigm](/docs/ethos) for building web applications.

## The Stack

A pre-wired configuration of specific frameworks, libraries, and dev tools. Straightforward, responsible choices for building reliable CRUD apps.

You don't have to deal with the foundational minutiae of starting a new project. The boring problems are solved: we've done the research, evaluated options, and put together a good starting point.

### Core Stack

- [Astro](https://astro.build) (SSR with [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) adapter and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) support)
- [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) (8.0) with [Kysely](https://kysely.dev/) query builder
- [Better-Auth](https://www.better-auth.com/)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) with [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/)

### Supporting Libraries

- [Alpine.js](https://alpinejs.dev/)
- [HTMX](https://htmx.org/)
- [Cropper.js](https://fengyuanchen.github.io/cropperjs/)
- [Dropzone](https://www.dropzone.dev/)
- [Flatpickr](https://flatpickr.js.org/) - Date picker
- [SortableJS](https://sortablejs.github.io/Sortable/)
- [Validator.js](https://github.com/validatorjs/validator.js)
- [Iconify](https://iconify.design/)
- [Nodemailer](https://nodemailer.com/)



## The Boilerplate

### Application Structure
- Middleware configuration
- Config management
- Database schemas
- Default CSP, CSRF validation for forms
- Environment variable handling
- Alias imports (`@/` path resolution)

### Authentication System
- JWT-based authentication middleware
- Role-based access control
- OAuth configured with Google login
- Login/register templates wired with Better-Auth and Nodemailer

### Components
- Form UI components
- Form and input validation
- Photo uploads and gallery management
- File upload handling with storage providers (S3/R2, Bunny.net, local filesystem)
- Image processing (optimization, cropping)

### Backend Utilities
- CRUD abstraction helpers
- Email notification components

### Admin App
- Simple base you can extend as needed
- Or ignore entirely

## The Philosophy

DW codifies best practices in a way that others can understand and follow. Clear coding standards with enough examples between the codebase and docs to understand how to build with this toolkit.
