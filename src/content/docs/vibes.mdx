Pre-wired full-stack components with purpose-specific functionality. Designed to provide a productive, efficient workflow built on reliable technology.

<div class="grid grid-cols-3 gap-1">
  <div class="p-1">
    <img src="/images/modular-vibes-1.webp" class="w-full" />
  </div>
  <div class="p-1">
    <img src="/images/modular-vibes-2.webp" class="w-full" />
  </div>
  <div class="p-1">
    <img src="/images/modular-vibes-3.webp" class="w-full" />
  </div>
  <div class="p-1">
    <img src="/images/modular-vibes-4.webp" class="w-full" />
  </div>
  <div class="p-1">
