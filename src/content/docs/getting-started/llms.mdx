dw - we built a codebase that's easy for LLMs to understand AND ALSO easy for people to understand (modern tech, but organized in a "simple" and highly readable way ... "obvious"/intuitive organization)
	Dw llm friendly toolkit - easy to work on with llms - esp cursor
	Dw llms - types (it's typescript!)

dw includes helpful context for llms
db schemas, etc
it's typescript! llms LOVE writing typescript!




TS is GREAT for AI
- you can write apps with this stack SO FREAKING FAST with claude & cursor 


Vibe code responsibly

It's like a condom for your risky vibe coding encounters
  Develop according to this spec (which can be easily understood by people and machines) and you'll be doing pretty good



easy to have llms write code based on this config
Doing things in clear and predictable ways using proven technology, avoiding doing anything too clever, efficient and reliable 




the combination of cursor/claude + astro + tailwind has changed my life! things that used to be hard are MUCH easier now. worth the tradeoff of SOME things being a little more involved (initial projeect setup, more complex mental models, etc) ... but it's SO worth it!!!
