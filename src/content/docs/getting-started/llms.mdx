DW is built to be easy for both humans and LLMs to understand.

## Why It Works

- **TypeScript** - LLMs excel at writing and understanding TypeScript
- **Clear organization** - Intuitive file structure with predictable patterns
- **Helpful context** - Database schemas and type definitions provide rich context

## AI-Assisted Development

The combination of Claude/Cursor + Astro + Tailwind enables incredibly fast development. You can write apps with this stack remarkably quickly using AI assistance.

## Best Practices

- Clear and predictable patterns using proven technology
- Nothing too clever - reliability over cleverness
- Efficient and maintainable code that both humans and AI can work with

Develop according to DW's conventions and you'll have a codebase that's easy to extend with AI assistance while remaining fully understandable to human developers.
