also you might need to do some software updates out of the box (that's just how this shit goes)
follow instructions if there are any alerts after you do `npm run dev` or `npm run build`

do an `npm audit` too, just for kicks

typically need to run `npm audit --fix`, `npx @astrojs/upgrade`, `npm install kysely@lates`, etc
