Common problems and how to address them.

## Dependency Updates

You may periodically need to run updates:

```bash
npm audit --fix
npm install kysely@latest
npx @astrojs/upgrade
```

If you're not familiar with JS development, this can seem overwhelming. This is normal. Don't be alarmed.

## Common Issues

### Build Errors

If `npm run build` fails:
1. Check for TypeScript errors with `npx astro check`
2. Ensure all dependencies are installed with `npm install`
3. Check that your `.env` file has all required variables

### Database Connection

If the app can't connect to the database:
1. Verify your database credentials in `.env`
2. Make sure MySQL is running
3. Check that the database exists and the user has proper permissions

### Auth Issues

If authentication isn't working:
1. Verify `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` is set in `.env`
2. Check that the auth tables were created with `npm run init`
3. For OAuth, ensure your provider credentials are configured correctly
