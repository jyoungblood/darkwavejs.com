title: External Resources
---
🚜


lists of helpful links (places to build themes, genenrate favicons, etc)
all the stuff i need to look up


NEW PLAN: put the resources in a different section (not part of the docs)
- cool styled page and nicely organized directory
- kinda like a blog or something, but it's an organized directory w/ comments
  - table layout would be good...it's just links, titles, & comments...maybe tags too
